## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We have created this analysis to visualize Des Moines bike-sharing data to share with stakeholders. This way, all stakeholders are properly informed of bike usage and revenue data. Visualizations were created and arranged on Tableau.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

Below, you can see first of many visualizations. This one shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. You can see in this image that most bike rentals peak between 0 and 20 minutes of rental and trend downward from there.

Next, you will see similar data but arranged by gender (male, female, and unknown). The same overall trend is depicted. However, one can see the uneven gender distribution of renters. The peak of renters around 10 minutes in was over 100,000 men but that same peak was closer to 30,000 female renters. The peak of unknown geners lingered around 4,000 rentals.

This next visualization is a heatmap that plots the number of bike trips by weekday by each hour of the day. The darker the color, the highere the usage. Therefore, the highest volume of bike trips in the weekday is around rush hour: 7-9 AM and 4-7pm.

Next, there is a similar heatmap that shows trip volume on weekdays but this one is divided up by gender. The same trends aare visible but depicted more intensely in the male category.

This next heatmaps takes the analysis one step further.
